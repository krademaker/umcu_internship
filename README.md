## UMC Utrecht internship code repository

This repository serves as a storage for various scripts used during an internship at the UMC Utrecht department of Translational Neuroscience. Scripts are organized into folders by topic, with each folder including a README detailing the functionality and installation requirements for scripts. Data used for analyses are not always included as re-uploading is typically not authorized by the authors, yet download links and required pre-processing steps are included to allow for reproducibility.

Feel free to explore and see whether some scripts are useful for your own analyses, after all: _'Why waste time re-inventing the wheel, when somebody else has already done it?'_
