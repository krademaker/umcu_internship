## UMC Utrecht internship code repository - Single Cell

### Background
Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technique to measure and quantify RNA transcripts from individual cells, allowing the transcriptomes of heterogeneous systems such as the brain to be measured with a high resolution. This folder includes scripts to process and visualize the 10x Genomics 1.3 million mouse brain cells scRNA-seq dataset [1]. 

### Approach
_TO-DO: Details of approach_

### Scripts
* **qc_restructure_10x_genomics.py** - Script for QC and restructuring of 10x Genomics mouse brain scRNA-seq data.
_TO-DO: Details of scripts_

_(details of subfolders are explained in their own READMEs)_

### Usage
**qc_restructure_10x_genomics.py**:

_Please note that loading and processing the full dataset requires at least 60 GB of RAM!_

_TO-DO: Details of usage_

### Requirements
